The Binomial and Geometric distributions are both made up of the same fundamental unit: trials. Each trial is an attempt at a task that can result in a success or failure. The Binomial models the probability of the number of successes in n trials (giving us the probability of 0 up to n successes occurring). Examples of the binomial are the number of hoops you make if you shoot a basketball n times, the number of orange M&M's you find in any given packet of M&M's, or the number of times you flip heads in n coin flips.

### Binomial Joy
The binomial has a nice, symmetric shape. It has two parameters: n, the number of trials you're attempting, and p, the probability of success for any given trial. The center and spread of a distribution changes as you tweak with these two parameters. Try creating some jagged, binomial art:
