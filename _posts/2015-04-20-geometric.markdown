The geometric distribution is discrete, meaning that you can only give it natural numbers. It has only one parameter, p, the probability of a "success" on a given attempt, and the distribution graphs the probability that you succeed on a given trial. The simple structure of a geometric distribution is "number of X until you Y". Some examples are: the number of coin flips until you get heads (a Geometric with probability 0.5), the number of die rolls until you roll a 6 (p = 1/6), the number of basketball shots attempted until you make it (let's say you're really good at basketball, so your probability of making any given shot is 0.8), and there is even Geometric to be found in the popular TV show [**Squid Game**](https://medium.com/geekculture/succeed-at-the-squid-games-glass-bridge-using-statistics-26635415de00){:target="_blank"}.
