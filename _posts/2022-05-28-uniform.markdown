Imagine every event in a collection of events occuring with the same chance. That's the uniform distribution. Examples of this would be each outcome for a die roll, fair coin flip, or random pick from a deck of cards.
### A lovely, (un)uniform quilt
Although the uniform distribution is very graphically predictable, we can still create art with it in the form of a probabilistic quilt! 
In this scenario, you're a quilt-maker with fabric of every imaginable color available to you. You close your eyes and randomly point to and select one color of fabric for each quilt patch, roll a die to choose one of six patterns for the patch, spin a spinner with three options to choose among three shapes for your patch (circle, diamond, or none), and roll another die and pick another random color if you chose a shape.
Repeat this process for each patch, and the result would look something like this:
<p class="codepen" data-height="558" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-slug-hash="VwQbdwO" data-user="worldsenddunce" style="height: 558px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
