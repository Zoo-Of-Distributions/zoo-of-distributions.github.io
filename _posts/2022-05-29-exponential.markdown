The graph of the exponential distribution is a steep, downward slope. It has one parameter: the amount of time it usually takes before something occurs. The situations this distribution models are usually framed as "Time until the next X," such as the time until the next major earthquake, how long your phone battery lasts (time until it dies), and the time until your next nap. 
### Your own Mondrian (kind of)
Here's a visual example of the exponential distribution at work. On average, this exponential draws lines a bit left of center (and repeats it in the horizontal direction), though the lines are quite spread out.

Notice that the timing of the drawn lines are also exponentially distributed-- the further left (or to the top) a line is, the faster it's drawn into the canvas!
