The Poisson distribution is discrete, and it has one parameter: the expected amount of times something occurs in a given timeframe (lambda). This is quite neat, as the number of occurences is a whole number despite time being continuous! The number of times you greet someone you know in a day, stub your toe in a month, or yawn in a long meeting or lecture are just a few examples of Poissons in everyday life.
### One Poisson, Two Poisson...
Did you know that poisson means fish in French? This means we can use the poisson to model the number of "poisson" that swim by in a given window. Try it yourself, and notice that as the lambda parameter gets bigger, the average number of fish that show up increases as well:

(The fishies like to jump out of the pond quite a bit-- it's a "feature," not a bug)
